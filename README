This project is a simple example of a Platform Independent Library (PIL).

The library is supported by the header file lrd_sdk_pil.h which should be 
part of the SDK header files.

The initial version of the PIL library allows the user to replace the 
functions for geting/seting the regdomain which is stored in the uboot
environment on the WB45 project.

Example - 

The example.c file contains an example of an extremely simplified PIL.
The user is expected to populate the LRD_WF_PilInfo structure with 
their company's relevant data.

All functions in the PIL are optional.  A user only needs to populate the 
functionality desired.

The PIL allows the user to supply unique serial numbers and product IDs
to their products.  A new function: LRD_WF_GetPilInfo() has been added
to sdc_sdk.h, and allows the user to retrieve the LRD_WF_PilInfo struct.

Any library initialization can be done in the library initialization 
routine: LRD_WF_PIL_Init() and similarly, a destructor routine is 
available with LRD_WF_PIL_Deinit()

In the example.c file, you can see we are storing the REG_DOMAIN value in 
a local static variable.  This is only for example as the user will likely
want to store this value in a persistent file on their device.
